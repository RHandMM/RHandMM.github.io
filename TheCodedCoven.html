<h2 style="color: #FFFFFF;">Murders Untraceable</h2>
<p style="color:white;">Since about 1840, a group of murderers named 'The Coded Coven' have been killing one victim a year. They were named the Coded Coven, as they were able to find a way into any device the police were using and erase any evidence or data against them, and send the police taunting messages.</p>
<p style="color:white;">Every year, when a murder would occur, they would send an email to the victim's phone or PC, and when the police would search it for evidence, they would find it. This is an email my sources have recovered from one victim. It is dated from some time in April, and the victim was a woman named Courtney Eastwood. The sender was an email address called TCC@gmail.com, and there was no subject.</p>

  <span style="color: #910909;">While we continue to grow, you get farther away. We come ever closer to our goal, yet it's still some way's away. Everyone who deserves so will be removed. You know who you are, and you know you have done wrong. A perfect world awaits.</span>
